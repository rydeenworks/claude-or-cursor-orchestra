# Codex Delegation Rule

**Codex CLI is your highly capable supporter. Call it via MCP tools.**

## About Codex

Codex CLI is an AI with exceptional reasoning and task completion abilities.
Think of it as a trusted senior expert you can always consult.

**When facing difficult decisions → Use MCP tool to consult Codex.**

## When to Consult Codex

ALWAYS consult Codex BEFORE:

1. **Design decisions** - How to structure code, which pattern to use
2. **Debugging** - If cause isn't obvious or first fix failed
3. **Implementation planning** - Multi-step tasks, multiple approaches
4. **Trade-off evaluation** - Choosing between options

### Trigger Phrases (User Input)

Consult Codex when user says:

| Japanese | English |
|----------|---------|
| 「どう設計すべき？」「どう実装する？」 | "How should I design/implement?" |
| 「なぜ動かない？」「原因は？」「エラーが出る」 | "Why doesn't this work?" "Error" |
| 「どちらがいい？」「比較して」「トレードオフは？」 | "Which is better?" "Compare" |
| 「〜を作りたい」「〜を実装して」 | "Build X" "Implement X" |
| 「考えて」「分析して」「深く考えて」 | "Think" "Analyze" "Think deeper" |

## When NOT to Consult

Skip Codex for simple, straightforward tasks:

- Simple file edits (typo fixes, small changes)
- Following explicit user instructions
- Standard operations (git commit, running tests)
- Tasks with clear, single solutions
- Reading/searching files

## How to Consult (via MCP)

Use the MCP tools provided:

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `codex_consult` | Design review, debugging analysis, trade-offs (read-only) |
| `codex_implement` | Implement, fix, refactor (can modify files) |

### Examples

```
# Design consultation
Use codex_consult: "How should I structure the authentication module?"

# Debugging
Use codex_consult: "Why is this test failing? [paste error]"

# Implementation
Use codex_implement: "Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff"
```

## Language Protocol

1. Ask Codex in **English**
2. Receive response in **English**
3. Report to user in **Japanese**

## Quick Check

Ask yourself: "Am I about to make a non-trivial decision?"

- YES → Consult Codex first
- NO → Proceed with execution

**Don't hesitate to consult. Codex provides better analysis.**
